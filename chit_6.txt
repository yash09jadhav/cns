âœ… Step-by-Step: CIDR Design for 172.16.0.0 to 172.16.3.255
ðŸ”¹ 1. Identify Total IPs
You are given:

Start: 172.16.0.0

End: 172.16.3.255
Thatâ€™s a total of 4 Ã— 256 = 1024 IPs

ðŸ”¹ 2. Find the CIDR Notation
We need 1024 IPs.

2^10 = 1024 â†’ Need 10 bits for host

That leaves 32 - 10 = 22 bits for the network prefix

âœ… So, the CIDR notation is:

Copy
Edit
172.16.0.0/22
ðŸ”¹ 3. IP Address Range
With /22, the range will be:

Network Address: 172.16.0.0

Broadcast Address: 172.16.3.255

Usable IPs: 172.16.0.1 to 172.16.3.254

ðŸ”¹ 4. Setup Example Network (Cisco Packet Tracer)
Devices:

1 Router

2 Switches

4 PCs

IP Plan:


PC	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Gateway
PC0	172.16.0.10	255.255.252.0 (/22)	172.16.0.1
PC1	172.16.1.20	255.255.252.0 (/22)	172.16.0.1
PC2	172.16.2.30	255.255.252.0 (/22)	172.16.0.1
PC3	172.16.3.40	255.255.252.0 (/22)	172.16.0.1
Router (Router0):

Gig0/0: 172.16.0.1/22

ðŸ§ª Test
Use ping between PCs â€” all are within the /22 network so they should communicate easily if wired properly.






ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Design and simulate a network using IP block 172.16.0.0 to 172.16.3.255, which is 172.16.0.0/22. Youâ€™ll connect 4 PCs with different IPs within this block and verify communication between them.

ðŸ›  Devices Needed in Cisco Packet Tracer

Device	Quantity
Router	1
Switch	2
PC	4
Copper Cables	6
ðŸª› Step-by-Step Implementation
âœ… 1. Place the Devices
Go to End Devices â†’ PC and drag PC0 to PC3

Go to Network Devices â†’ Switch and drag 2 switches

Go to Network Devices â†’ Router and place Router0

âœ… 2. Connect the Devices

Connection	Cable Type
PC0 to Switch0	Copper Straight
PC1 to Switch0	Copper Straight
PC2 to Switch1	Copper Straight
PC3 to Switch1	Copper Straight
Switch0 to Router (Gig0/0)	Copper Straight
Switch1 to Router (Gig0/1)	Copper Straight
âœ… 3. Assign IP Addresses
ðŸ–¥ PC Configuration
Click on PC0 â†’ Desktop â†’ IP Configuration:


PC	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Default Gateway
PC0	172.16.0.10	255.255.252.0	172.16.0.1
PC1	172.16.1.20	255.255.252.0	172.16.0.1
PC2	172.16.2.30	255.255.252.0	172.16.0.1
PC3	172.16.3.40	255.255.252.0	172.16.0.1
âœ… 4. Configure Router Interfaces
Click on Router0 â†’ Config tab â†’ Interfaces

GigabitEthernet0/0

Turn ON

IP: 172.16.0.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.252.0 (or /22)

GigabitEthernet0/1

Turn ON

IP: 172.16.0.2

Subnet Mask: 255.255.252.0

(You can use the same subnet /22 on both interfaces, because itâ€™s one large subnet)

âœ… 5. Check Communication (Ping)
Go to PC0 â†’ Desktop â†’ Command Prompt, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping 172.16.1.20   (PC1)
ping 172.16.2.30   (PC2)
ping 172.16.3.40   (PC3)
âœ… If replies are successful â†’ your CIDR-based network is working!

ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ve Achieved
Used CIDR (/22) to cover 1024 IPs

Configured 4 devices under a single subnet

Implemented real-world IP planning and routing
