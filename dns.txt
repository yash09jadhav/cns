🌐 Role of DNS in Network Communication
📖 What DNS Does:
DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.182.36)

It's like a phonebook for the internet

💡 Why It's Important:
We remember names, not numbers

DNS allows users to access websites, servers, and devices using friendly names

Without DNS, we would have to type IP addresses every time
